# Autoencoders

## Description:

Essentially, an autoencoder is a neural network that's trained to copy its input to its output. It has two main parts: an encoder, which compresses the input into a hidden layer, and a decoder, which reconstructs the input from this hidden layer. What's amazing is that the hidden layer's reduced dimensionality forces the autoencoder to learn the most important features of the data, making it useful for tasks like dimensionality reduction, denoising, and even generating new data similar to the input!
