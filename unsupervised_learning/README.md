# Unsupervised Learning

## Description:

Unlike supervised learning, which relies on labeled data to make predictions or classifications, unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data to identify structure, extract features, or find anomalies. It's the go-to approach for tasks like customer segmentation, recommendation systems, and anomaly detection, offering a way to make sense of complex data without the need for manual labeling.
