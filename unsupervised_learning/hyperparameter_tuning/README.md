# hyperparameter_tuning

## Description:

Hyperparameter tuning is a crucial step to enhance model performance. It involves experimenting with different hyperparameters to find the optimal configuration for a machine learning algorithm. For instance, while working with a Random Forest model, tweaking parameters like the number of trees or the maximum depth of trees can lead to better predictive performance.
