# Clustering

## Description:

Clustering in machine learning is basically like sorting your music playlist into different moods or genres. You've got a bunch of songs (data points), and you want to group the similar vibes together. So, you use algorithms like K-means to automatically find those groups for you. It's a super handy tool when you've got a ton of data and you're trying to make sense of it all.
