# HMM

## Description:

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are a statistical framework I leverage to model sequential data. Through HMMs, I can represent and analyze the hidden states and observable sequences in a system. This framework is especially useful in scenarios like speech recognition or financial market analysis, where understanding the underlying states from observable data is crucial. With HMMs, I can decode the hidden state sequences, estimate state distributions, and learn the model parameters to make better predictions and analyses over sequential data, enriching my machine learning projects.
