# transfer_learning

## Description:

Essentially, it is a process that allows us to leverage the knowledge gained from one machine learning task to improve performance on a different, but related task. This comes in handy, especially in situations where we have limited data for the new task. Rather than training a model from scratch, which can be time-consuming and computationally expensive, I can use a pre-trained model that has been trained on a large dataset, and then fine-tune it to the specific task at hand. The idea is that these pre-trained models have already learned to extract useful features from the data, and we can capitalize on this learning to give our new task a head start. This approach has shown immense success, particularly in the field of deep learning.
