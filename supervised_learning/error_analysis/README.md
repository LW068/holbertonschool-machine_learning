# Error Analysis

## Description: 

In machine learning, error analysis involves the evaluation of a model's performance using various metrics. This includes assessing the confusion matrix, which provides a visual representation of the model's true and false positives and negatives; examining Type I and Type II errors; and measuring sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, and F1 score. It also involves understanding the concepts of bias and variance, which describe the model's tendency to consistently learn the same wrong thing (bias) versus its sensitivity to fluctuating patterns in the training data (variance). Additionally, error analysis includes recognizing the presence of irreducible error and approximating the Bayes error, the latter being the lowest possible error rate achievable by any classifier for a given problem.
