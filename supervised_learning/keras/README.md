# Keras

## Description:

Keras is a high-level neural networks API written in Python that runs on top of TensorFlow. It provides a user-friendly interface for building and training deep learning models. With Keras, you can quickly prototype and build complex neural networks by connecting layers together. It offers a wide range of built-in functions and classes for defining layers, selecting activation functions, specifying loss functions, choosing optimizers, and evaluating model performance. Keras simplifies the process of developing deep learning models, making it accessible to both beginners and experienced researchers.
