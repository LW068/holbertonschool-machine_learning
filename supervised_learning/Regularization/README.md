# Regularization

## Description:

Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on new, unseen data. Overfitting happens when a model captures noise in the training data, mistaking it for a real pattern. Regularization addresses this by adding a penalty to the loss function based on the complexity of the model. If the model's weights (parameters) are large, the penalty is large, discouraging the model from using complex or extravagant solutions. This helps the model to generalize better from the training data to unseen data, improving its overall performance. There are several types of regularization, including L1 and L2 regularization, each of which applies this penalty in slightly different ways.
