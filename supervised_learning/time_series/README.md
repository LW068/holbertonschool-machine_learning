# Time Series

## Description:

 Time series forecasting in machine learning involves analyzing historical time-based data to predict future trends. It utilizes concepts like stationarity to model and understand the data. Techniques such as the sliding window method are used to reframe the problem for machine learning models. TensorFlow, with its robust data handling and RNN capabilities, provides a comprehensive platform for implementing these techniques effectively.
