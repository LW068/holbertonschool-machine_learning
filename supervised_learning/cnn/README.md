# Convolutional Neural Networks

# Description: 

In this project, I'm diving deep into the world of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a class of deep learning models that are primarily used for analyzing visual data. CNNs are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from the input data, which makes them highly efficient for tasks like image and video processing. My aim is to understand and implement the inner workings of CNNs, including convolutional and pooling layers, as well as forward and backward propagation within these layers, all with the aid of TensorFlow and Keras.
