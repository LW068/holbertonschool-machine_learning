## Description:

Object detection is a computer vision technique that involves identifying and locating objects within an image or video. Unlike simple image classification, which identifies what objects are present, object detection also determines where those objects are within the frame. It often employs algorithms such as Sliding Windows, single-shot detectors (SSD), and You Only Look Once (YOLO), which use features like anchor boxes and intersection over union (IOU) to accurately identify and localize multiple objects of various types. Object detection has diverse applications, including facial recognition, autonomous driving, and augmented reality, making it a vital component in modern artificial intelligence.
