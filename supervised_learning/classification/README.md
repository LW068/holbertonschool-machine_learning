# Classification

## Description:

Classification is a type of supervised learning in machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset. The model learns to predict discrete, categorical labels or classes based on the input data. Once the model is trained, it can be used to classify new, unknown instances. Examples of classification tasks include email spam detection, cancer cell identification, and image recognition, where the output variable is a category, such as 'spam' or 'not spam' for email, 'cancerous' or 'non-cancerous' for cells, and 'cat', 'dog', 'bird', etc. for images.
