# Recurrent Neural Netowrks

## Description:

You can imagine them as a kind of brain cell in a computer that's really good at remembering things from the past. Unlike our regular thoughts that can jump from topic to topic, RNNs maintain a sort of memory that helps them understand sequences, like sentences in a book or steps in a dance. This makes them particularly clever for tasks where what came before is important to what comes next, like predicting the next word you're about to type on your phone. They're not perfect, and can struggle with really long memories, but they're a key part of how machines are learning to understand our world over time.
