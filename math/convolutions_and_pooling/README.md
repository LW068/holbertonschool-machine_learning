# convolutions_and_pooling

## Description:

Convolutions and pooling are fundamental operations in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used for image and signal processing tasks. Convolutions involve sliding a small filter (also known as a kernel) over the input data and performing element-wise multiplications followed by summation to produce a new feature map. This operation captures local patterns and spatial dependencies in the data. Pooling, on the other hand, reduces the spatial dimensionality of the feature maps by downsampling. It helps to extract the most important features while reducing computational complexity. Max pooling is a common pooling technique that selects the maximum value within each pooling region. It helps to retain the most salient information. Convolutional layers with pooling are typically stacked in CNN architectures to extract hierarchical representations from the input data, enabling the network to learn complex patterns and objects at different levels of abstraction.
