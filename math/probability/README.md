# Probability

## Description:

Probability is a fundamental concept in statistics and machine learning that quantifies the likelihood of events. It provides a mathematical framework for reasoning about uncertainty, which is inherent in the predictions and decisions made by machine learning models. Understanding probability helps in designing more effective models, interpreting their predictions, and evaluating their performance. It is especially crucial in areas such as Bayesian inference, probabilistic graphical models, and reinforcement learning.
