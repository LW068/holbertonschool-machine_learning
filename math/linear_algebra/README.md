# Linear Algebra

Welcome to my Linear Algebra project! This is where I've immersed myself in one of the fundamental mathematical areas in Machine Learning - Linear Algebra.

In this project, I've explored a variety of Linear Algebra concepts, from basic operations with vectors and matrices to more complex operations such as matrix inversions and determinants. I've also delved into the practical applications of these concepts in the field of Machine Learning, such as transforming data, understanding high-dimensional space, and optimizing Machine Learning models.
