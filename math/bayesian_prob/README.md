# bayesian_prob

## Description:

In Bayesian probability, we use Bayes' Rule to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. Unlike traditional statistics, which treats probabilities as long-term frequencies, Bayesian probability considers 'probability' as a measure of believability or confidence. The core idea is to start with an initial belief (the prior), update it with data (the likelihood), and arrive at a final belief (the posterior). This approach is incredibly powerful for making data-driven decisions and is widely used in machine learning, data science, and statistics.
