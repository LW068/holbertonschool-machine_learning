# Mathematics in Machine Learning

## Description:

Welcome to the 'math' directory of my Machine Learning repository! Here, I've compiled a variety of projects that showcase my exploration and understanding of foundational mathematical concepts that underpin the field of Machine Learning.

The 'math' directory is where the magic begins! It's the cornerstone of all the fascinating things we do in Machine Learning. Each project in this directory aims to enhance my understanding of these subjects, applying them in practical, real-world Machine Learning scenarios.
